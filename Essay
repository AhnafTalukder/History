The forced annexation of the Philippines will not only smear the U.Sâ€™s image with the blood of the innocent, but it will also bring about long-term political changes that have the possibility to stray away from the Constitution.

As a result, I advise you to think over your decision and consider a more peaceful approach: to build a navy base with the alliance of the Filipinos.
